## Massachusetts Education Analysis

**ARE STUDENTS READY FOR GRADUATION?** 

Being an educator for several years, our school district's main goal was to prepare our students for the real world.  We wanted to gear all of the learning for a student toward their graduation and make sure they are ready to graduate and ready for the future.  Teachers focused on what skills a graduate needed to have to be successful in their future job.  As young as Kindergarten age, these students were being prepared to find a job and be successful in the workforce.  Starting in 4th grade, students began to take standardized tests to predict how successful they would be when they graduated. 

Massachusetts schools were also preparing their students for the workforce.  The Superintendent wanted to analyze their education data looking for the following information:

<ul>
  <li>What schools are struggling the most? </li>
  <li>How does class size affect college admission?</li>
  <li>What are the top math schools in the state?</li>
  <li>Create a report to show the school board the state of the school system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>THE DATA</h2>

The dataset was provided as a Microsoft Excel file for the year 2017.  This data contains 1861 rows of school district data with 299 columns representing information about the schools demographics, class sizes, salaries, expenditures, number of students that graduated, test scores, and other district information.  

The data was imported into Tableau to analyze and create the visualization board.  

<h2>KEY FINDINGS</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Class sizes</b> did not have much impact on graduation rates.  Although, the optimum class size falls between 12 and 20 students. </li> 
  <li>More <b>Economically disadvantaged</b> schools did have a little lower graduation rate than other schools.</li>
  <li>Finally, 75 schools in Massachusetts scored more than 50% <b>Proficient and Advanced</b> on their 4th grade math assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>THE ANALYSIS</h2>

The first task was to find out <b>which schools were struggling the most</b>.  In Tableau I created this graph showing the schools with the lowest graduation rate.

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```

### 2. You can add any images you'd like.
